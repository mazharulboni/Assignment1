Test the capabilities of this new Role.

Using the AWS CLI, assume that updated role and list the S3 buckets in the us-east-1 region.

Acting as this role, try to create an S3 bucket using the AWS CLI.

Did it succeed? It should not have!
If it succeeded, troubleshoot how Read access allowed the role to create a bucket.
